# RikChan
A simple chan framework made in python

##Installation Guide
Make a `static/media` folder in your directory. This is where media will be stored. Run `create_admin.py` to make an admin account. Go to `/_ct_` to create a board.

## Todo

- A system to login/logout for janitors/mods/admins
- A system to log the IP of poster (Chans are notorious, and I plan to delete the information of the poster once the post gets deleted)
- A system to show miscellaneous stuff along with the post
- Tripcode support
